## Detection
video_input: 0              # Input Must be OpenCV readable 
visualize: True             # Disable for performance increase
vis_text: True              # Display fps on visualization stream
max_frames: 5000            # only used if visualize==False
width: 600                  # OpenCV only supports 4:3 formats others will be converted
height: 600                 # 600x600 leads to 640x480
fps_interval: 5             # Interval [s] to print fps of the last interval in console
det_interval: 500           # intervall [frames] to print detections to console
det_th: 0.5                 # detection threshold for det_intervall
split_model: True           # Splits Model into a GPU and CPU session (currently only works for ssd_mobilenets)
log_device: False           # Logs GPU / CPU device placement
allow_memory_growth: True   # limits memory allocation to the actual needs
image_path: 'test_images'   # used for image_detection.pyq
ssd_shape: 300              # used for the split model algorithm
                            # currently only supports ssd networks trained on 300x300 and 600x600 input

## Tracking
use_tracker: False          # Use a Tracker (currently only works properly without split_model)
tracker_frames: 5           # Number of tracked frames between detections
num_trackers: 5             # Max number of objects to track


## Model
model_name: 'ssd_mobilenet_v11_coco'
model_path: 'models/ssd_mobilenet_v11_coco/frozen_inference_graph.pb'
label_path: 'object_detection/data/mscoco_label_map.pbtxt'
num_classes: 90
